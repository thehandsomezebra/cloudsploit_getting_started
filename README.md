# cloudsploit: getting started

This is a basic script to use CloudSploit: AWS.

It will output to a csv file.

The bash script is pretty simple.. and in itself, it doesn't inherently take account for any of the CloudSploit plugins. If you want to, you can do that yourself.

Just edit the code, dude.


Also -- this should run on mac or linux no probz.

## Pre Reqs:
- Make sure that you have git installed.
- `git clone` this repo

## how to run:

```bash
./aws.sh
```

and then fill in the prompts...

...that's it...
