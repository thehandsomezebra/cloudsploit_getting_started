# cloudsploit: getting started

This is a basic script to use CloudSploit.

It will output to a csv file.

The bash script is pretty simple.. and in itself, it doesn't inherently take account for any of the CloudSploit plugins. If you want to, you can do that yourself.

Just edit the code, dude.


Also -- this should run on mac or linux no probz.

## Pre Reqs:
- you need to be able to `wget`.. seriously. figure it out.
- it will check for (and install if you don't already have it) `git` and `npm`.

## how to run:

- go to your terminal. Copy/pasta this:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehandsomezebra/cloudsploit_getting_started/master/getting_started_with_cloudsploit.sh  -O ~/.cache/getting_started_with_cloudsploit.sh && source ~/.cache/getting_started_with_cloudsploit.sh
```

- and then fill in the prompts...
- ...that's it...


also.. this only works for AWS right now. If you need more, either do it yourself or write a bug report for me & I'll add something for you.
